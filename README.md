# cub3d

A simple 3D raycasting game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, written in C using the MiniLibX graphics library. This project is part of the 42 School curriculum and aims to teach the basics of raycasting, graphics, and game engine architecture.

## Description

**cub3d** is a graphical project that introduces you to raycasting and basic game engine concepts. The goal is to render a 3D environment from a 2D map using the MiniLibX library. The project includes both a mandatory part (basic raycasting, textures, player movement) and a bonus part (minimap, sound, animated sprites, doors, weapons, enemies, etc).

---

## Features

- Raycasting engine (Wolfenstein 3D style)
- Texture mapping for walls, floor, and ceiling
- Player movement and rotation (keyboard and mouse)
- Map parsing and validation (custom .cub format)
- Error handling and input validation
- Modular code structure (mandatory/bonus separation)
- Bonus: Minimap, audio, animated sprites, doors, weapons, enemies, etc.

---

## Project Structure

- `projects/mandatory/` : Main source files for the mandatory part
- `projects/bonus/`     : Source files for the bonus part (minimap, sound, etc)
- `includes/`           : Header files (structs, macros, function prototypes)
- `libraries/`          : External libraries (libft, minilibx)
- `assets/`             : Textures (`.xpm`), sounds (`.wav`), sprites
- `maps/` or `libraries/maps/` : Example map files (`.cub`)
- `Makefile`            : Build system

---

## Map Format

Map files (`.cub`) define the world and resources. Example:

```plaintext
NO      ./assets/textures/env/1.xpm   # North wall texture
SO      ./assets/textures/env/2.xpm   # South wall texture
WE      ./assets/textures/env/3.xpm   # West wall texture
EA      ./assets/textures/env/4.xpm   # East wall texture
F       140,140,140                   # Floor color (RGB)
C       180,240,255                   # Ceiling color (RGB)

				1111
	111111111111111001
	101000000000011001
	100000000000011011
	100000100000011001
	100000000000000001
	101011110000011001
	...
```

**Legend:**
- `1` = Wall
- `0` = Floor
- `N`, `S`, `E`, `W` = Player start position and direction
- `D` = Door (bonus)
- `A` = Enemy (bonus)
- Spaces are ignored

**Bonus map keys:**
- `GR` = Ground texture
- `WP` = Background/wallpaper
- `CR` = Crosshair texture

---

## Installation

```sh
make
```

- Requires: `gcc`, `make`, and dependencies for MiniLibX (X11 for Linux, OpenGL for macOS).
- The Makefile will automatically clone and build `libft` and `minilibx` if not present.

---

## Usage

```sh
./cub3d <map_file.cub>
```

- Example: `./cub3d libraries/maps/ascent_mandatory.cub`

---

## Controls

- `W/A/S/D` or Arrow keys: Move/rotate player
- Mouse: Look around (bonus)
- `ESC`: Exit the game
- `SPACE`: Interact (open/close doors, bonus)
- `MOUSE1`: Fire weapon (bonus)

---

## Bonus Features

- Minimap rendering
- Animated sprites (weapons, enemies, doors)
- Sound effects (SDL2, .wav)
- Multiple weapons (knife, vandal, skills)
- Enemies with basic AI
- Doors (open/close)
- Crosshair, HUD, FPS counter
- Skybox, ground textures, background

---

## Dependencies

- [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) (graphics)
- [libft](https://github.com/yigit-toq/42_Cursus) (custom C library)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) (for audio, bonus)

---

## Norminette

To check code style:

```sh
make norminette
```
